/** Locale primitives shared by Studio services and every interface.
 *
 * Two different concepts wear the word "locale" in this system and they must
 * not be conflated:
 *
 * - StudioLocale is the *interface* language of the owner — bot screens, the
 *   Command Center, MCP replies. Adding one is three edits: a member here, a
 *   native name below, and one more object in the message catalog. Every
 *   `Record<StudioLocale, …>` in the tree then fails to compile until it is
 *   filled in, which is the whole point.
 * - The `"ru" | "en"` spelled out inline across publishing, delivery and
 *   channels is a *content* language: what a post is written in. It is pinned
 *   to those two by the channels that exist, and a new interface language must
 *   never widen it. Do not reach for StudioLocale there.
